Patching WebALT library to be forward compatible with resource library changes.
Aarne Ranta, 13 September 2008


Main idea: Use the user API only, not the linguistic core grammar.

This includes:
- Syntax
- Symbolic
- Paradigms, Besch, Irreg

Do *not* use
- Lang, Grammar, Noun, Verb,...
- Mathematical (to become obsolete in RG 1.5, anyway)
- Morpho, Res, Diff,...


The current refactored version will work with RG 1.5 out of the box.

What was not done in the revision:
- "greater than or equal to" -- wait for next RG
- variant orders of subjunction
- Finnish symbol inflection -- wait for patch


What was done as a by-product:
- WebaltRules eliminated
- Most contents of Math?? moved to MathForms

Example question-answering system using GF

Author: Laurette Marais, laurette.p@gmail.com

This was a project for the GF Summer School 2018 at Stellenbosch. The goal
was to implement a multilingual question-answering system that neatly separates
generic question-answering functionality from the specifics of a particular
domain/query service.

The main idea is that the grammar is developed so that questions and answers
have almost identical parse trees, except that trees parsed from questions have
empty nodes, while trees linearised into answers are complete. The abstract
grammar is implemented with a question and an answer concrete module for each
language. For example, the following tree is linearised in Afrikaans and English
in two ways:

WeatherFact: ElementFact Stellenbosch (Temperature (FNum 25.0))
WeatherFactAfrQ: wat is die temperatuur in Stellenbosch ?
WeatherFactAfrR: die temperatuur in Stellenbosch is 25.0 grade Celsius
WeatherFactEngQ: what is the temperature in Stellenbosch ?
WeatherFactEngR: the temperature in Stellenbosch is 25.0 degrees Celsius

Parsing the question in either language results in the following tree, where the
node contributing the answer content is empty:
ElementFact Stellenbosch (Temperature ?2)

The task of the QA system is to:
- find the empty nodes in a tree parsed from a question
- construct the appropriate query by analysing the tree
- receive and interpret the response
- construct any subtrees that are missing
- insert the missing subtrees to produce a complete tree
- linearise the complete tree as an answer

The system can also handle more extensive questions:

WeatherFact: ElementsFact
               CapeTown
               (MoreElements
                 (TwoElements
                   (Humidity (FNum 70.0))
                   (Clouds (FNum 65.0)))
                 (Temperature (FNum 25.0)))
WeatherFactAfrQ: wat is die temperatuur , humiditeit en wolkdekking in Kaapstad ?
WeatherFactAfrR: in Kaapstad is die temperatuur 25.0 grade Celsius , die
                humiditeit 70.0 persent en die wolkdekking 65.0 persent
WeatherFactEngQ: what is the temperature , humidity and cloud coverage in Cape
                Town ?
WeatherFactEngR: in Cape Town , the temperature is 25.0 degrees Celsius , the
                humidity is 70.0 percent and the cloud coverage is 65.0 percent

Locations in trees are represented in a very simplistic way, with reference only
to the node's parent function and its position in the list of children, but it
could be made more precise if necessary by using a full path specification from
the root.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The QA system is implemented in Python 3 using the bindings to the C runtime.
OpenWeatherMap provides a free API for getting current weather data from around
the world.

The main module is qa:
usage: qa.py [-h] topic language question

positional arguments:
  topic       Eg. 'weather'
  language    (3-letter ISO-code)
  question    Eg. 'what is the weather like in Stellenbosch?'

The other modules are:
qa_utils: used by qa and weather to manipulate parse trees
weather: domain specific, responsible for interpeting and constructing
         parse trees
openweathermap: responsible for querying domain specific service

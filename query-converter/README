Query Converter

(c) Aarne Ranta 2015 under the BSD License

A simple converter for SQL, relational algebra, E-R diagrams, functional dependencies, normal forms, 
database schemas, XML, and some natural language.

To unpack the binary: do this in a terminal in the directory where you have the .gz file:

  gunzip qconv-mac.gz
  mv qconv-mac qconv

or 

  gunzip qconv-linux.gz
  mv qconv-linux qconv

To run:

  ./qconv

To compile from source:

  ghc --make -o qconv QConv.hs

Facilities:

- convert SQL queries to relational algebra expressions
- convert simple text scripts to E-R diagrams and database schemas
- build and use databases in SQL via relational algebra
- convert relational database to XML

Examples:

- edu.txt    -- E-R design: try with 'd edu.txt'
- fd-ex.txt  -- functional dependencies, try with 'f fd-ex.txt' or 'n fd-ex.txt'
- course.sql -- SQL script: try with 'i course.sql'

These examples, together with qconv sources, can be found from

  https://github.com/GrammaticalFramework/gf-contrib/tree/master/query-converter/

Other programs needed:

- pdflatex  -- to display algebra formulas
- graphviz  -- to display E-R diagrams

and possibly:

- ghc       -- to compile sconv from source

ToDo:

- many features of SQL: types, constraints, updates, deletes...
- natural language generation and parsing (rudiments included)
- fix bugs

# Finnic minifunctor

Work in progress!

This is a first attempt at a Finnic functor: a GF grammar that would cover 
the similarities between Finnish, Estonian, and other related languages, such as 
Karelian and Votic.
Most of the functions are copied from existing Finnish or Estonian grammars.

Usage:

```
> gf finnish/MiniLangFin.gf estonian/MiniLangEst.gf

Languages: MiniLangEst MiniLangFin
MiniLang> gr | l
tark loom
älykäs eläin
```

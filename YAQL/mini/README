Miniature query language

This is a mini YAQL, but has some of the same functionality. Try:

  ./query.sh "is 81 prime"
  False

For another way to implement this, see

  http://www.grammaticalframework.org/~hallgren/Talks/GF/Tutorial2012/Ex4/answer.html

which uses a semantic interpreter built in Haskell (instead of linearization to Haskell); this is the more
scalable solution explained in the GF book, Chapter 7.

Experimental Haskell implementation of Type Theory with Records. Functionalities:
- BNF grammar for TTR source files
- parsing TTR source files
- type checking TTR source files
- evaluating TTR expressions
- printing TTR source in Latex (two-dimensional records, math symbols, etc)


Based on TTR examples in
- Cooper & Ginzburg, Handbook, 2015
  https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01138034/file/rc-jg-ttrsem-final%20(1).pdf

In addition, some arithmetical expressions are added to allow computations.

Usage:

  runhaskell TryTTR          -- open TTR shell where expressions can be evaluated
                    <file>   -- type check file, open shell for evaluation in context of file
		    - nocheck <file>    -- the same, without type checking
		    - latex   <file>    -- convert file to latex code (no type checking)


Examples:

  runhaskell TryTTR ex2.ttr >ex2.tex   -- followed by pdflatex ex2.pdf
  runhaskell TryTTR ex3.ttr            -- for evaluation
  runhaskell TryTTR -nocheck ex2.ttr   -- for evaluation (does not type checked because contains undeclared constants)


The implementation is based on
- BNFC, as parser and skeleton generator:
  http://bnfc.digitalgrammars.com/
- AR, "Implementing Programming Languages", for general methodology and expression evaluation:
  http://www1.digitalgrammars.com/ipl-book/
- Thierry Coquand, "An algorithm for type checking dependent types", for type checking:
  http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~coquand/type.ps
- Bj√∂rn Bringert and AR, "A pattern for almost compositional functions", for efficient tree traversal
  http://www.cse.chalmers.se/alumni/bringert/publ/composOp-jfp/composOp-jfp.pdf
 

Notice:
- The implementation uses "deep embedding", which means that TTR is completely isolated from Haskell.
- The type checking algorithm is based on a model-theoretic interpretation of TTR (see Coquand's paper)


To do:
- more subtyping support (now supports limited structural record subtyping with co- and contravariance)
- union, intersection, complement, join types
- bug fixes, in particular in the type checking of records

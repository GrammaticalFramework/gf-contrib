gf-contrib
==========

Community contributions to the Grammatical Framework â€” http://www.grammaticalframework.org/

A place for new applications, evolving resource grammars, and other things that are not yet established enough to get into the GF core package,
(or which we maybe never want to distribute there).

    GF core = compiler + runtimes + standard libraries + central docs

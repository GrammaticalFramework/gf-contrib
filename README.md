gf-contrib
==========

Community contributions to the Grammatical Framework â€” http://www.grammaticalframework.org/

A place for new applications, evolving resource grammars, and other things that are not yet established enough to get into the GF core package,
or which do not belong there.

    GF core = compiler + runtimes + standard libraries + central docs

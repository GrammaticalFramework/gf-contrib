Translating Homotopy Type Theory in Grammatical Framework

===Abstract=== 

We have built a GF grammar (http://www.grammaticalframework.org) that parses an English text and
converts it into type-theory-like formal notation.
This is the start of a project for translating between natural language and formalized mathematics. 
The current grammar is still very rough and brittle.

==News==

22/10 Some refactoring; French added.

21/19/2014 First version.


==Files==

To get the sources: https://github.com/GrammaticalFramework/gf-contrib/tree/master/homotopy-typetheory

[ltestEng.pdf ltestEng.pdf], a text whose source is recognizable and producible by the grammar. 
Follows a text by Peter Aczel almost verbatim. This text is very compact and dense, but follows the formal structure 
very closely.

[ltestFre.pdf ltestFre.pdf], the same in French, as translated by the grammar.

[ltestEng.tex ltestEng.tex], the source of the English text.

[ltestLogic.txt ltestLogic.txt], the source translated to logical notation by GF.

[ltestTrees.txt ltestTrees.txt], the abstract syntax trees obtained by GF parsing.

[macros.tex macros.tex], some macros used in the text.

[Framework.gf Framework.gf], abstract syntax for textual structures.

[Formulas.gf Formulas.gf], abstract syntax for material presented as LaTeX formulas.

[HottLexicon.gf HottLexicon.gf], abstract syntax for a homotopy type theory lexicon.

[FrameworkFunctor.gf FrameworkFunctor.gf], concrete syntax functor for textual structures in natural language.

[FrameworkInterface.gf FrameworkInterface.gf], domain-specific interface for the functor.

[FrameworkInstanceEng.gf FrameworkInstanceEng.gf], English instance of the domain-specific interface.

[FrameworkInstanceFre.gf FrameworkInstanceFre.gf], French instance of the domain-specific interface.

[FrameworkEng.gf FrameworkEng.gf], concrete syntax for textual structures in English, instantiating the functor.

[FrameworkFre.gf FrameworkFre.gf], concrete syntax for textual structures in French, instantiating the functor.

[FormulasLatex.gf FormulasLatex.gf], concrete syntax for LaTeX formulas to be embedded in English.

[HottLexiconEng.gf HottLexiconEng.gf], concrete syntax for a homotopy type theory lexicon in English.

[HottLexiconFre.gf HottLexiconFre.gf], concrete syntax for a homotopy type theory lexicon in English.

[FrameworkLogic.gf FrameworkLogic.gf], concrete syntax for textual structures in a type-theory-like formalism.

[FormulasLogic.gf FormulasLogic.gf], concrete syntax for formulas in the formalism.

 

==To try it yourself==

Make sure that you have recent enough a version of GF, 3.6.10-darcs Oct 21, 2014, or later. This is needed to
get the correct lexing and unlexing behaviour for latex code.
```
  -- start GF in a Unix shell
  gf

  -- import the top files
  i HottLexiconLogic.gf 
  i HottLexiconEng.gf
  i HottLexiconFre.gf

  -- look at the lexed test file
  rf -file=ltestEng.tex -lines | ps -lines -lexmixed

  -- look at the parse trees
  rf -file=ltestEng.tex -lines | ps -lines -lexmixed | p -lang=Eng

  -- convert parse trees to logic
  rf -file=ltestEng.tex -lines | ps -lines -lexmixed | p -lang=Eng | l -lang=Logic -unlexcode

  -- translate English to French
  rf -file=ltestEng.tex -lines | ps -lines -lexmixed | p -lang=Eng | l -lang=Fre -bind -unlexmixed
```
The translation takes 20 milliseconds on my early-2013 MacBook Pro. This means that we could translate 
a 500-page book in 10 seconds - or a bit more, if the pages are longer.



==Documentation==

See comments in the GF files themselves.

See [my CADE paper http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~aarne/articles/cade2011.pdf] 
and this [earlier LPAR paper http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-44404-1_6]
for ideas on translating mathematics between type theory and natural language texts.


==To do==

Most things. Here are some in a priority order:

- improve the translation to logic, with particular attention on side effects and anaphoric expressions
- port to other languages
- create API's for easy extension of lexicon
- extend the syntax
- extend the lexicon
- move the periods into math displays either by pre/postprocessing (easy) or by modifying the linearization types (more elegant, but
  feels like overkill)


==Grammatical Framework==

GF = Logical Framework + concrete syntax. 

GF was originally develop on top of the proof editor ALF. But non-mathematical applications have dominated since 1998. GF has libraries supporting over 30 languages, and the functor used in the current experiment could be readily instantiated in 29 of them:
the ones that implement the full API of GF Resource Grammar Library.

The HoTT grammar should follow these [best practices http://www.molto-project.eu/sites/default/files/MOLTO_D2.3.pdf]

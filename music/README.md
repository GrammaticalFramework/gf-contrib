Music.gf -- basic building blocks; types `Note`, `Phrase`, `Piece`, `Score` (for Lilypond output). Independent of scale.
MusicC.gf -- concrete syntax for those. (Lilypond function puts it relative to middle C, just change for your needs.)

Pentatonic.gf -- Music ** notes in pentatonic scale
PentatonicC.gf -- Those notes in C.

Diatonic.gf -- Music ** new stuff like tonic, dominant; notes do,re,mi,fa,so,la,ti.
DiatonicC.gf -- Those notes in C major.

Conversion from Smultron treebank to GF trees
Work in progress!

Smultron has 4 English, Swedish, German, French and Spanish.
English version uses Penn Treebank tags.

SmultronFormat.hs 
   - reads the sentences in a Smultron .xml file into a Haskell tree.
ConvertEng.hs 
   - converts the English sentences in Smultron into GF trees.
All the rest
   - mostly copied from http://www.grammaticalframework.org/treebanks/PennTreebank/

data/nonsense_data_in_smultron_format.xml 
   - a sentence which *does not appear* in the original Smultron treebank 
     (nor is it translatable just by changing the words), but shows the format.

TODO
  - Finish English conversion
  - Add Convert(Swe|Spa|Ger|Fre)
  - Support other tag formats

How to use:

1) Sort the wordlist so it can be split into sublists. It is necessary because
the converter is quite memory-hungry, and you might not have enough RAM to
process the whole wordlist at once.

./CollectLemmas dicc.src | sort > lemmas.src

2) Split the sorted wordlist.

split -l 500000 lemmas.src

3) Splitting has probably left forms of some lemmas spread across two
sublists. Manually edit sublists so all forms for a lemma are present in just
one sublist.

4) Run the converter.

./run_conv.sh xa*

5) The converter has produced abstract and concrete syntaxes for the
dictionary. You can try them out with GF:

gf DictRus.gf

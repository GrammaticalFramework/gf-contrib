Icelandic WordNet v1.0

IceWordNet is based on Princeton Core WordNet.

The file core-isl.txt has the same format as core-wordnet.txt which can be downloaded from http://wordnetcode.princeton.edu/standoff-files/core-wordnet.txt.

Core WordNet is a list of approximately 5000 of the most common words from the Princeton list. The Icelandic wordnet, IceWordNet, contains Icelandic translations of the words in the core list in addition to the Icelandic synonyms. For now, only synonyms are given and other relations are not shown.

The Princeton Core WordNet list was downloaded from the Internet. Then the English words were translated into Icelandic and finally the synonyms of the Icelandic words were listed with the help from the Icelandic Thesaurus (Svavar Sigmundsson 1985) and the web site snara.is. The work was carried out by Kristín M. Jóhannsdóttir.
